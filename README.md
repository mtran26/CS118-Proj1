Project 1

Simple HTTP Client and Server 
The project entails developing a server program that listens for HTTP requests through a TCP socket and sends the requested file along
with an HTTP response message to the client. 

The client is any web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, that connects to the server (such a localhost) and the requested file 
name. 

The server supports HTML, JPEG, and GIF files.
